# TestU01 Randomness Tests

## TestU01
TestU01 is a standard test suite for testing the randomness of PRN, which can test longer random sequences and is much more stringent than NIST. The test suite is available at http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html.

## Experiments
In our randomness test, eight batteries, including *FIPS-140-2*, *PseudoDIEHARD*, *Alphabit*, *Rabbit*, *BlockAlphabit*, *SmallCrush*, *Crush*, *BigCrush*, are utilized to test the randomness of the proposed PRNG. 

The initial values of variables $x$ and $y$ are generated by calling random function, and the connection weights are specified as $(g11, g12, g21, g22) = (2, 2, −2, 2)$.We focus on the influence of the neuron internal decay parameter $μ$ on the PRNGs for the 2-D DBHNN Model, shown in **Table I**. As can be observed, the PRNGs can be passed through all batteries of TestU01, according to the excellent secure performance of the chaotic signals generated by the 2-D DBHNN Model. 

Therefore, the 2-D DBHNN Model is suitable for the application of PRNG.
